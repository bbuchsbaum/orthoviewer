\usage{
ortho_viewer_dependencies(include_surface = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{include_surface}{Logical: include Three.js and surfviewjs?
Defaults to FALSE.}
}
\value{
A list of \code{htmltools::htmlDependency} objects, or NULL.
}
\description{
Returns additional \code{htmlDependency} objects that should be
included with the widget.  When \code{include_surface} is TRUE,
Three.js and surfviewjs are bundled so the surface viewer can
initialise immediately.  When FALSE (slice-only mode), those
~600 KB libraries are omitted; they will be lazy-loaded from
JavaScript if surface mode is activated later via a proxy command.
